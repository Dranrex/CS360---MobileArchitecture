- Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app was developed to aid in inventory management which means that it needed a database to store items and their quantities, as well as user information to add a layer of security.

- What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Only two basic screens were necessary in this iteration, the login page and the inventory screen. The features were a database, as mentioned before, using SQLite, for storing users and inventory as well as adding and subtracting quantities of items.

- How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

First was prototyping the app by including text, buttons, and layout. Followed by adding the necessary functionality of these widgets. The inclusion of SQLite databases, different activities, and widgets will all be useful for future app development.

- How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I used an emulator and ensured all functions operated as intended in the emulator. Testing is one of the most crucial aspects of development as code should be error free as much as possible and work as intended.

- Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

The inclusion of Databases and "Rooms" which had caused the app to crash due to the configuration of the gradle to become outdated, but didn't throw exceptions or errors that were obvious.

- In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I don't think I was particularly successful in any aspect, but I think the inclusing of SQLite when I never learned any SQL was pretty demonstrative of skill.
